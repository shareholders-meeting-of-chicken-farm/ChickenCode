/*
   1.suppose two numbers:x and y,with their gcd n.we have ax + by = n * (ax/n + by/n)
     for x/n and y/n are relatively prime,there exists a&b,so that ax/n + by/n = 1
     so we can have conclusion:ax + by = gcd(x,y) has solution

   2.in the array,if two numbers are relatively prime,the sum themselves can be 1,return true
     otherwise,with sum(x,y,a,b) = gcd(x,y)*k,we choose k=1,and get gcd(x,y) as newNumber,to compare to next number in array
     among all possible sum,gcd(x,y) is most likely to be relatively prime with next number
     reason1:k can be 1 based on the conclusion above,other values are not sure
     reason2:if gcd(x,y)*k is relatively prime to next number z,gcd(x,y) must also be the sameï¼Œ
             but gcd(gcd(x,y),z) = 1 can not prove gcd(gcd(x,y)*k,z) = 1
